@article{columbiaUHIlandsberg,
	Abstract = {An account of seven years of meteorological observations in the growing town of Columbia, Howard County, Maryland, in the Baltimore-Washington corridor is given. Information was collected from fixed stations and mobile surveys. In the interval from 1968 to 1975 the town grew from 200 to 20000 inhabitants, with building activity eliminating the original diversified rural microclimates. An unmistakable urban heat island has developed that is quite notable nocturnally when it maximally reaches 8$\,^{\circ}$ C in the densely built-up town center. The time series of the maximal heat island is linearly related to the logarithm of population figure. At midday on sunny days the IR surface temperatures are directly proportional to the per cent of area built-up. The radiation balance reflects the changes in the urbanized area. There is little heat loss from evapotranspiration but large heat transport into the surface (day) and out of the surface (night). No effect on precipitation is (as yet) discernible. Relative humidities are lower in the town area than in the rural district. Roughness has increased and wind speeds have been reduced. In all seasons, except summer, hours of turbulent wind have decreased. Run-off has become typically urban and air pollution has increased (presumably from motor vehicle traffic). All findings support earlier studies on town climate and reveal considerable detail on the progress of atmospheric modification in the urbanization process.},

	Abstract = { Remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST) from the thermal band data of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) still remains unused in comparison with the extensive studies of its visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands for various applications. The brightness temperature can be computed from the digital number (DN) of TM6 data using the equation provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, a proper algorithm for retrieving LST from the only one thermal band of the sensor still remains unavailable due to many difficulties in the atmospheric correction. Based on thermal radiance transfer equation, an attempt has been made in the paper to develop a mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from Landsat TM6 data. Three parameters are required for the algorithm: emissivity, transmittance and effective mean atmospheric temperature. Method about determination of atmospheric transmittance is given in the paper through the simulation of atmospheric conditions with LOWTRAN 7 program. A practicable approach of estimating effective mean atmospheric temperature from local meteorological observation is also proposed in the paper when the in situ atmospheric profile data is unavailable at the satellite pass, which is generally the case in the real world especially for the images in the past. Sensitivity analysis of the algorithm indicates that the possible error of ground emissivity, which is difficult to estimate, has relatively insignificant impact on the probable LST estimation error i T, which is sensible to the possible error of transmittance i  6 and mean atmospheric temperature i T a . Validation of the simulated data for various situations of seven typical atmospheres indicates that the algorithm is able to provide an accurate LST retrieval from TM6 data. The LST difference between the retrieved and the simulated ones is less than 0.4$\,^{\circ}$C for most situations. Application of the algorithm to the sand dunes across the Israel-Egypt border results in a reasonable LST estimation of the region. Based on this LST estimation, spatial variation of the interesting thermal phenomenon has been analysed for comparison of LST difference across the border. The result shows that the Israeli side does have significantly higher surface temperature in spite of its denser vegetation cover than the Egyptian side where bare sand is prevalent. },

	Abstract = {Urban heat island effect refers to the phenomenon that ambient air and surface temperatures in urban areas are several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. Higher temperatures not only impact the comfort of urban dwellers, but also increase energy use, ozone production, and the risk of death for humans in a heat wave. Our research focuses on the variation in land surface temperature in the Gywnns Fall Watershed, Maryland. We found that land surface temperature is highly variable spatially, resulting in ``hotspots'' within the heat island. We further explore how this temperature variation relates to social factors on the scale of the census-based block group. We show that land surface temperature is statistically higher in block groups that are characterized by low income, high poverty, less education, more ethnic minorities, more elderly people and greater risk of crime. These variables were mapped to evaluate the spatial relationship of land surface temperatures to social factors. This spatially explicit approach facilitates identification of specific areas to prioritize for heat prevention and intervention efforts. We demonstrate, through an exercise, how incorporating data on land surface temperature and social factors into heat intervention strategies could contribute to efficient allocation of limited resources and services. The exercise also indicates where heat prevention efforts, such as tree-planting programs, are most needed to help reduce heat exposure and moderate the urban heat island effect. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Air temperature (Ta) stations have limited spatial coverage, particularly in rural areas. Since temperature can vary greatly both spatially and temporally, Ta stations are often inadequate for studies on the health effects of extreme temperature and climate change. Satellites can provide us with daily physical surface temperature (Ts) measurements, enabling us to estimate daily Ta. In this study, we aimed to extend our previous work on predicting Ta from Ts in Massachusetts by predicting 24 h Ta means on a 1 km grid across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, extending both the temporal and spatial coverage, improving upon the methodology and validating our model in other geographical regions across the Northeastern part of the USA. We used mixed model regressions to first calibrate Ts and Ta measurements, regressing Ta measurements against day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random Ts slopes. Then to capture the ability of neighboring cells to fill in the cells with missing Ts values, we regress the Ta predicted from the first mixed effects model against the mean of the Ta measurements on that day, separately for each grid cell. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample \{R2\} = 0.95 and \{R2\} = 0.94 respectively). We demonstrate how Ts can be used reliably to predict daily Ta at high resolution in large geographical areas even in non-retrieval days while reducing exposure measurement error. },

	Abstract = {The reconstruction of urban climate is still challenging to climatologists in spite of over five decades of research including direct data measurement and model building. Methods for measuring and monitoring urban climate have strengths and weaknesses depending on the application. The mapping of patterns of urban heat stress over a city is not useful if the patterns depicted apply only to the time of data acquisition. Since thermal satellite sensors can now provide detailed temperature data covering whole cities and beyond, their adoption in urban planning depends on demonstrating their relevance to commonly prevailing conditions. This research investigates and presents a methodology based on four summertime \{ASTER\} thermal satellite images of Hong Kong for urban heat stress mapping at detailed level. It demonstrates that satellite images obtained under certain climatic conditions, and accompanied by adequate `in situ' ground data, can provide a basis for an operational heat stress mapping system. The temporal limitation of thermal satellite images is examined for both day and nighttime images by comparison of image-derived air temperatures with ground data representing extended periods and other hot days and nights outside the image acquisition times. The nighttime images were found to be more representative of air temperature at other times than the daytime images, due to a more stable boundary layer, with lower wind speeds and temperature inversion at night. The nighttime images showed high and significant correlations with ground level air temperatures for an average 13-h period surrounding the image time 10.42pm, from 6 pm to 4--8 am the next day. Additionally they were highly and significantly correlated with ground air temperature distributions on 93% of all hot summer nights in the same years. Therefore the nighttime images can be considered representative of a commonly occurring summer nighttime situation in Hong Kong, and can be used to determine the locations of areas where temperatures commonly exceed hot weather warning thresholds. Notably, the images were better able than climate stations to represent areas in the urbanized Kowloon Peninsula and several smaller satellite towns which exceeded hot weather warning thresholds. Many areas exceeded the thresholds, even when no hot weather warning was in force, due to the unrepresentative location of climate stations. The images were also more able than climate stations to indicate the hottest and coolest areas over the Hong Kong territory, thereby enabling measurement of the magnitude and extent of the urban heat island. },

@article{urbangreeningreview,
	Abstract = {`Urban greening' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was 0.94 $\,^{\circ}$C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day. However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health through reducing temperature. },

	Abstract = {As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme heat, cities and their urban heat island (UHI) effects are growing, as are the urban populations encountering them. These mutually reinforcing trends present a growing risk for urban populations. However, we have limited understanding of urban climates during extreme temperature episodes, when additional heat from the UHI may be most consequential. We observed a historically hot summer and historically cold winter using an array of up to 150 temperature and relative humidity sensors in and around Madison, Wisconsin, an urban area of population 402 000 surrounded by lakes and a rural landscape of agriculture, forests, wetlands, and grasslands. In the summer of 2012 (third hottest since 1869), Madison's urban areas experienced up to twice as many hours ⩾32.2 $\,^{\circ}$C (90 $\,^{\circ}$F), mean July T MAX up to 1.8 $\,^{\circ}$C higher, and mean July T MIN up to 5.3 $\,^{\circ}$C higher than rural areas. During a record setting heat wave, dense urban areas spent over four consecutive nights above the National Weather Service nighttime heat stress threshold of 26.7 $\,^{\circ}$C (80 $\,^{\circ}$F), while rural areas fell below 26.7 $\,^{\circ}$C nearly every night. In the winter of 2013--14 (coldest in 35 years), Madison's most densely built urban areas experienced up to 40% fewer hours ⩽−17.8 $\,^{\circ}$C (0 $\,^{\circ}$F), mean January T MAX up to 1 $\,^{\circ}$C higher, and mean January T MIN up to 3 $\,^{\circ}$C higher than rural areas. Spatially, the UHI tended to be most intense in areas with higher population densities. Temporally, both daytime and nighttime UHIs tended to be slightly more intense during more-extreme heat days compared to average summer days. These results help us understand the climates for which cities must prepare in a warming, urbanizing world.},

	Abstract = {Heatwave intensity and frequency are predicted to increase in the coming years, and this will bear adverse consequences to the environmental well-being and the socio-economic fabric in urbanized areas. The hazardous combination of increased heat storage and reduced water retention capacities of the land surface make the urban areas warmer than the surrounding rural areas in what is commonly known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The primary motives of this study are to quantify the interaction of this city-scale UHI with synoptic-scale heatwave episodes and to analyze the factors that mediate this interaction. A modified version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is utilized to simulate two heatwave episodes in New York City. The land surface scheme in the default WRF model is modified to better represent the surface to atmosphere exchanges over urban areas. Our results indicate that during the heatwave episodes, the daily-averaged UHI in NYC increased by 1.5 K. Furthermore, most of this amplification occurs in the mid-afternoon period when the temperatures peak. Wind direction and urban-rural contrasts in available energy and moisture availability are found to have significant and systematic effects on the UHI, but wind speed plays a secondary role.},

@article{Tan2010,
	Abstract = {With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975--2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998--2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.},
