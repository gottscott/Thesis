\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I thank the City of Baltimore, Baltimore residents and the numerous Baltimore community groups that have made this work possible by hosting instruments and inviting me to present on this research. In particular, I acknowledge Jennifer Kunze and Kristin Baja for their critical support. 

I also thank my advisors, Darryn Waugh and Ben Zaitchik for their support and guidance, as well as the JHU EPS Oceans and Atmospheres research group for comments and feedback on my preliminary results.

Finally, I thank my friends and family for supporting me all these years.
